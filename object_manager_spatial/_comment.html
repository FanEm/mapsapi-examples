<p>
    <sa href="ObjectManager"/> - A class for adding a large number of objects to the map
    without needing to create placemarks and add them to the map individually.
</p>
<p>
    The objects added to ObjectManager are located in the ObjectManager.objects collection. The visual representation of placemarks and clusters
    are objects that implement the <sa href="IOverlay"/> interface.
    Overlays are placed in the ObjectManager.objects.overlays and ObjectManager.clusters.overlays collections, respectively.
</p>
<p>
    <sa href="ObjectManager"/>accepts placemark descriptions in JSON format. Placemarks can be clustered or shown as-is.
    If you don't use clusterization, the placemarks will be shown only in the visible map area.
    Since objects are stored in the manager as JSON descriptions and their visual representation is created only when necessary,
    this method of adding points to the map works faster than adding placemarks to the map directly or via the clusterer.
